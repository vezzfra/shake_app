# Shake App
An iOS app to generate random contemporary art masterpieces.

This was an high school project I decided to realize programming an application for iOS devices. 
The functioning of the code was quite easy: 

    - A determined number of cropped parts of abstract art masterpieces were loaded inside the app;
    - After launching the app, the user could shake its phone like he was mixing the parts;
    - The app then returned a random generated image obtained moving and rotating the single art pieces. 
    
Every part of the app was already in the project and there was no backend.
